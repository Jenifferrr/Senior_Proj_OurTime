# Senior_Proj_OurTime
All the Java classes are in Senior_Proj_OurTime/app/src/main/java/com/example/calendar
This is where we wrote all our Java code.
Senior_Proj_OurTime/app/src/main/res: This is where all our layout files are. All the UI for the application.
Repository zip should be downloaded and then extracted into Android Studio Project files and then opened inside the application. To compile and run on the emulator included. 
Thank you for this opportunity.
